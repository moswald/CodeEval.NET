#Challenge description:

Write a program to determine the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary search tree. You may hardcode the following binary search tree in your program:

        30
        |
      ____
      |   |
      8   52
      |
    ____
    |   |
    3  20
        |
       ____
      |   |
      10 29

#Input sample:

The first argument is a path to a file that contains two values. These values represent two nodes within the tree, one per line. E.g.:

    8 52
    3 29

#Output sample:

Print to stdout the lowest common ancestor, one per line. Lowest means the lowest depth in the tree, not the lowest value. E.g.:

    30
    8
